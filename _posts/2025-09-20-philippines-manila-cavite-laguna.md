Many roadside durian stalls with tree dropped near KatÃ  kape (7F6Q+H47, Cavinti, Laguna, Philippines). 

Background is people that moved from Davao brought seeds with them. 

PHP60 (S$1.4) per kg, PHP240 (S$5.5) for 2 very ripe fruits.

Very creamy, with 60% bitter with some bruising fermentation in 1st fruit, and 20% bitter in 2nd fruit.

Unfortunately unfamiliar with what varieties they are...didn't video all around the outside ofÂ eachÂ fruitÂ also

The dogs there eat durian ğŸ˜‚.
