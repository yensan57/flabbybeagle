Davao City durian hunting spanned 3 locations: 1) SM Lanang popup event, 2) Magsaysay, 3) Bankerohan Public Market

<u>SM Lanang Special Popup Event</u>

During durian season (Sep onwards), there will be random popup events at malls around Davao City. In this particular event at SM Lanang, all the durians seemed unripe, hence were skipped.

<u>Magsaysay</u>

We immediately headed over to the main famous touristy street called Magsaysay where durian sellers are arranged in a single row right beside the road.

Almost all were unripe, again, but at least we found one fruit that had a bit of a smell. It was unevenly ripe.
