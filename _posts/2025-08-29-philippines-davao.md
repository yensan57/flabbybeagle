<u>SM Lanang Special Popup Event</u>

During durian season (Sep onwards), there will be random popup events at malls around Davao City. In this particular event at SM Lanang, all the durians seemed unripe, hence were skipped.

We immediately headed over to the main famous touristy street called Magsaysay where durian sellers are arranged in a single row right beside the road.
