Davao City durian hunting in Sep 2025 spanned 3 locations: 1) SM Lanang popup event, 2) Magsaysay, 3) Bankerohan Public Market

<u>SM Lanang Special Popup Event</u>

During Davao durian season (Aug onwards), there are known to be random popup events at malls around the city. In this particular event at SM Lanang mall, all the durians seemed unripe, hence were skipped.

<u>Magsaysay</u>

We immediately headed over to the main famous touristy street called Magsaysay where durian sellers are arranged in a single row right beside the road.

Almost all were unripe, again, but at least we found one fruit that had a bit of a smell. It was unevenly ripe.

<u>Bankerohan Public Market</u>

Next day, we checked out another less touristy market, Bankerohan. It is supposed to be where locals go to, over Magsaysay. 

We didn't buy anything, because most seemed unripe again, and we were heading to Belviz Durian Farms which has tree ripe durians anyway.

But prices looked much better than Magsaysay.
