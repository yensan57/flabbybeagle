First time visiting the famous Belviz Farms in Davao, Sep 2025. Initially hung around the main visitor plot and ate durians, before taking a short drive to another plot with a real-time live MSW durian tree drop.

<u>Belviz Durian Farms main visitor plot</u>

Belviz Durian Farms is a farm that does tree ripe and tree dropped durians. Featured many times on Year Of The Durian blog.

Very friendly growers, Emmanuel and Mary Grace Belviz, manage multiple plots and host informative tours of their place.

Varieties fruiting while we were visiting:
PH: Duyaya, Nanam, Sulit, GD69, Arancillo, many more
MY: Musang King, (growing Black Thorn seedlings!), kampung
TH: Monthong, etc

But not many varieties were ripe on that day itself sadly.

We chose Monthong (sweet obviously), Arancillo (bitter), Malaysian Kampung (D8, bitterish). Was hoping to try more local varieties. Served with chocolate cacao also grown on the farm.

This was followed by a tour around the main visitor plot. Really interesting experience to not just eat fresh durian but to learn about the farm history and different local durian varieties.

<u>Belviz Durian Farms side plot with live MSW fruit drop</u>

Short drive to another plot with a 150 year old tree.

This other farm plot also had a 20 year old Musang King tree that super luckily, a fruit literally just dropped in front of our eyes when we passed it.

Obviously we had to eat this not-even-1h-ago freshly dropped from the tree MSW.

How we wished the 150 year old tree also dropped a fruit when we visited.
